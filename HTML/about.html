            <p>Say hiheyhello to your KDC Team!</p>
            <p>
              We are two creatives, Ant and Bex, if you will, who cut their
              teeth in the arts, education, and healthcare sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're here to bring affordable digital magic to people who have
              big ideas they are cooking up at home. We are here for you big
              dreamers, you fearless creators, bedroom selftapers, and future
              self-made winners.
            </p>

            <p>
              Think of us as your digital accomplices – we know our way around
              both pixel-perfect design and purpose-driven projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              While bigger agencies have the corporate vibe down and charge in
              the thousands, we keep things refreshingly simple and personal.
            </p>
            <p>
              We love working with other creative and entrepreneurial people and
              bouncing ideas around, because truly two (or more) brains are
              better than one!

              <p>
                Not to age me, but I remember the internet launching and have
                seen all the trends come and go. So I have a lock on how to
                create the best website for you!
              </p>
              <p>
                I spent nearly 15 years working in Mental Health, supporting
                people to live the life they want. However, my interest has
                always been in the arts. I am an actor and improviser, having
                trained in and taught improv around the UK and US.
              </p>
              <p>
                You would think mental health, performing, and websites are
                wildly different, but what links them is the idea of
                <span class="shrikhand-regular"
                  >supporting individuals to be their best selves, and
                  incorporating joy into their lives.</span
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023 I retrained in Web Development, noticing a gap in the
                market for accessible and affordable web development for the
                Arts and small business. I am just as passionate about
                supporting other people’s dreams, as I am about following mine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of work, I love to travel. A few years ago I quit my
                job, sold my house and travelled South America with Bex. Also,
                seeing live bands fills my spare time, but I now have to wear
                supportive trainers to gigs, otherwise I get a backache.

              <p>
                You want to know a bit about me? I am half Ecuadorian, half
                English and living across both hemispheres has certainly shaped
                who I am.

              <p class="shrikhand-regular">
                I would say I am determined, have a great eye, and I’m pretty
                hilarious (my friends would totally agree).
              </p>
              <p>
                Having spent a large chunk of time not knowing the who and what
                of my life, I now embrace all of me and I believe all of us can
                and should showcase our true unique selves.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked in Arts and Education for a decade, picking up a thing
                two about great branding along the way. When you are trying to
                keep a classroom full of Gen Z engaged, you better be pulling
                out the visual big guns!

                My design start came, making educational resources for arts and
                education charities, where I quickly realised that I had an eye
                for making attention-grabbing content and I really enjoyed the
                artistic element which was something I had been lacking in my
                work life.
              </p>
              <p>
                When not working, I like getting up late, reading tarot, dancing
                Burlesque, and drinking pints of Guinness.
